So, to bring liquidity and HFT on collectibles market we have to make tradeable fractions of these items (tokenize them).

When you tokenize a skin, you're not creating a copy of it, you're turning it into something that can move faster than Steam allows.
Think of it like putting a skin into a vault and getting a digital receipt back.
That receipt, the token, proves you own a piece of that item and can trade it any time.

We've seen this before. Gold gets locked in vaults, and banks issue receipts that can be traded, redeemed, or used as collateral.

Same idea here. The real skin stays in [the vault](/../how-inventory-works/skin-vault). The token moves freely.

Each token is tied to a real skin, with a clear one-to-one relationship.
- **Deposit** a skin → **mint** its tokens.
- **Burn** tokens → **redeem** the skin.

It's a bridge between the slow world of Steam and the instant world of on-chain markets.
And since the tokens are backed by real items, they inherit their value — the vault is the anchor, and the blockchain is the rail.
